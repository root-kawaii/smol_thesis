  abstract = {Objective: Artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) is an automatic, online-capable, component-based method that can effectively remove transient or large-amplitude artifacts contaminating electroencephalographic (EEG) data. However, the effectiveness of ASR and the optimal choice of its parameter have not been systematically evaluated and reported, especially on actual EEG data. Methods: This paper systematically evaluates ASR on 20 EEG recordings taken during simulated driving experiments. Independent component analysis (ICA) and an independent component classifier are applied to separate artifacts from brain signals to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the ASR. Results: ASR removes more eye and muscle components than brain components. Even though some eye and muscle components retain after ASR cleaning, the power of their temporal activities is reduced. Study results also showed that ASR cleaning improved the quality of a subsequent ICA decomposition. Conclusions: Empirical results show that the optimal ASR parameter is between 20 and 30, balancing between removing non-brain signals and retaining brain activities. Significance: With an appropriate choice of parameter, ASR can be a powerful and automatic artifact removal approach for offline data analysis or online real-time EEG applications such as clinical monitoring and brain-computer interfaces.},

We demonstrate how phase angle statistics can be used to gain confidence in causal relationships and test mechanistic models of physical relationships between the time series. As an example of typical data where such analyses have proven useful, we apply the methods to the Arctic Oscillation index and the Baltic maximum sea ice extent record. Monte Carlo methods are used to assess the statistical significance against red noise backgrounds.

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing to decode motor imagery (MI) involves high-dimensional features, which increases the computational complexity. To reduce this computational burden due to the large number of channels, an iterative multiobjective optimization for channel selection (IMOCS) is proposed in this paper. For a given MI classification task, the proposed method initializes a reference candidate solution and subsequently finds a set of the most relevant channels in an iterative manner by exploiting both the anatomical and functional relevance of EEG channels. The proposed approach is evaluated on the Wadsworth dataset for the right fist versus left fist MI tasks, while considering the cross-validation accuracy as the performance evaluation criteria. Furthermore, 12 other dimension reduction and channel selection algorithms are used for benchmarking. The proposed approach (IMOCS) achieved an average classification accuracy of about 80\% when evaluated using 35 best-performing subjects. One-way analysis of variance revealed the statistical significance of the proposed approach with at least 7\% improvement over other benchmarking algorithms. Furthermore, a cross-subject generalization of channel selection on untrained subjects shows that the subject-independent channels perform as good as using all channels achieving an average classification accuracy of 61\%. These results are promising for the online brain{\textendash}computer interface (BCI) paradigm that requires low computational complexity and also for reducing the preparation time while conducting multiple session BCI experiments for a larger pool of subjects.},

  abstract = {The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm is a popular method for efficiently calculating spatial filters. However, several previous studies show that CSP's performance deteriorates especially when the number of channels is large compared to small number of training datasets. As a result, it is necessary to choose an optimal subset of the whole channels to save computational time and retain high classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm to select the optimal channels for CSP. The CSP procedure is applied to training datasets firstly and then a channel score based on l{\textbackslash} norm is defined for each channel. Finally, channels with larger scores are retained for further CSP processing. This approach utilizes CSP procedure twice to select channels and extract features, respectively; hence the complex optimization problem of channel selection for CSP is solved heuristically. We apply our method and other two existing methods to datasets from BCI competition 2005 for comparison and the experiment results show this method provides an effective way to accomplish the task of channel selection.},

  abstract = {Decoding of motor imagery (MI) from Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important component of BCI system that helps motor-disabled people interact with the outside world via external devices. One of the main issues associated with the multiclass classification of MI based EEG is the informative confusion due to non-stationary characteristics of EEG data. In this work, an innovative idea of transforming EEG signal into a new domain, weight vector of autoencoder, unsupervised neural network, is proposed for the first time to solve that confusion. These weight vectors are optimized according to that particular EEG signal. The features: autoregressive coefficients (ARs), Shannon entropy (SE) and wavelet leader were extracted from the weight vector. A rectangular windowing-based feature extraction technique is implemented to capture the local features of the EEG data. Finally, extracted features were used in the support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier network. The proposed method is implemented on two openly available EEG dataset (BCI competition-III and Competition-IV) to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology over the newly reported methods. For four-class EEG based MI classification, the proposed technique has achieved an average test accuracy of 95.33\% and 97\% for dataset-IIIa from BCI-III and dataset-IIa from BCI-IV respectively. The experimental results reveal that, the proposed technique is a promising solution to improve the decoding performance of BCIs.},

Thus, optimal channel selection becomes a key factor for developing a more comfortable BCI. This study emphasized on a time-frequency (T-F) coherence method, called as Wavelet Coherence (WC), for selecting lesser number of channels. The selected sets of channels were then used to classify two motor imagery (MI) tasks, i.e., right hand (RH) and right foot (RF). The data was collected from publicly available dataset IVa from BCI Competition III. Common spatial pattern (CSP) with and without regularization were applied as preprocessing techniques. While the classification accuracy is 90\% using available 118 channels for subject ay, we have achieved higher classification accuracy of 93\% using only 24 channels using CSP with regularization. Interestingly, the achieved classification accuracy for subject av is 67\% using 4 channels only, that outperform the classification accuracy (i.e., 61\%) achieved using 118 channels.},

Therefore, channel selection is crucial while ensuring classification accuracy.MethodsThis paper proposes a channel selection method by integrating the efficient channel attention (ECA) module with a convolutional neural network (CNN). During model training process, the ECA module automatically assigns the channel weights by evaluating the relative importance for BCI classification accuracy of every channel. Then a ranking of EEG channel importance can be established so as to select an appropriate number of channels to form a channel subset from the ranking. In this paper, the ECA module is embedded into a commonly used network for MI, and comparative experiments are conducted on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a.Results and discussionThe proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 75.76\% with all 22 channels and 69.52\% with eight channels in a four-class classification task, outperforming other state-of-the-art EEG channel selection methods. The result demonstrates that the proposed method provides an effective channel selection approach for EEG-based MI-BCI.},

Many electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems use a large amount of channels for higher performance, which is time-consuming to set up and inconvenient for practical applications. Finding an optimal subset of channels without compromising the performance is a necessary and challenging task. Approach. In this article, we proposed a cross-correlation based discriminant criterion (XCDC) which assesses the importance of a channel for discriminating the mental states of different motor imagery (MI) tasks. Channels are ranked and selected according to the proposed criterion. The efficacy of XCDC is evaluated on two motor imagery EEG datasets. Main results. In both datasets, XCDC significantly reduces the amount of channels without compromising classification accuracy compared to the all-channel setups. Under the same constraint of accuracy, the proposed method requires fewer channels than existing channel selection methods based on Pearson's correlation coefficient and common spatial pattern. Visualization of XCDC shows consistent results with neurophysiological principles. Significance. This work proposes a quantitative criterion for assessing and ranking the importance of EEG channels in MI tasks and provides a practical method for selecting the ranked channels in the calibration phase of MI BCI systems, which alleviates the computational complexity and configuration difficulty in the subsequent steps, leading to real-time and more convenient BCI systems.},
