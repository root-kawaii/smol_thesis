  abstract = {Objective:  Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is FDA-approved for epilepsy, depression, and obesity, and stroke rehabilitation; however, the morphological anatomy of the vagus nerve targeted by stimulatation is poorly understood. Here, we used microCT to quantify the fascicular structure and neuroanatomy of human cervical vagus nerves. Approach: We collected 8 mid-cervical vagus nerve specimens from 5 fixed cadavers (3 left nerves, 5 right nerves). Analysis focused on the "surgical window": 5 cm of length, centered around the VNS implant location. Tissue was stained with osmium tetroxide, embedded in paraffin, and imaged on a microCT scanner. We visualized and quantified the merging and splitting of fascicles, and report a morphometric analysis of fascicles: count, diameter, and area. Main results: In our sample of human cervical vagus nerves, a fascicle split or merge event was observed every {\textasciitilde}560 {\textmu}m (17.8 {\textpm} 6.1 events/cm). Mean morphological outcomes included: fascicle count (6.6 {\textpm} 2.8 fascicles; range 1 to 15), fascicle diameter (514 {\textpm} 142 {\textmu}m; range 147 to 1360 {\textmu}m), and total cross-sectional fascicular area (1.32 {\textpm} 0.41 mm2; range 0.58 to 2.27 mm). Significance: The high degree of fascicular splitting and merging, along with wide range in key fascicular morphological parameters across humans may help to explain the clinical heterogeneity in patient responses to VNS. These data will enable modeling and experimental efforts to determine the clinical effect size of such variation. These data will also enable efforts to design improved VNS electrodes.},

Here, we restored this communication with a digital bridge between the brain and spinal cord that enabled an individual with chronic tetraplegia to stand and walk naturally in community settings. This brain--spine interface (BSI) consists of fully implanted recording and stimulation systems that establish a direct link between cortical signals3 and the analogue modulation of epidural electrical stimulation targeting the spinal cord regions involved in the production of walking4--6. A highly reliable BSI is calibrated within a few minutes. This reliability has remained stable over one year, including during independent use at home. The participant reports that the BSI enables natural control over the movements of his legs to stand, walk, climb stairs and even traverse complex terrains. Moreover, neurorehabilitation supported by the BSI improved neurological recovery. The participant regained the ability to walk with crutches overground even when the BSI was switched off. This digital bridge establishes a framework to restore natural control of movement after paralysis.},

  abstract = {Upper limb amputation is a condition that significantly restricts the amputees from performing their daily activities. The myoelectric prosthesis, using signals from residual stump muscles, is aimed at restoring the function of such lost limbs seamlessly. Unfortunately, the acquisition and use of such myosignals are cumbersome and complicated. Furthermore, once acquired, it usually requires heavy computational power to turn it into a user control signal. Its transition to a practical prosthesis solution is still being challenged by various factors particularly those related to the fact that each amputee has different mobility, muscle contraction forces, limb positional variations and electrode placements. Thus, a solution that can adapt or otherwise tailor itself to each individual is required for maximum utility across amputees. Modified machine learning schemes for pattern recognition have the potential to significantly reduce the factors (movement of users and contraction of the muscle) affecting the traditional electromyography (EMG)-pattern recognition methods. Although recent developments of intelligent pattern recognition techniques could discriminate multiple degrees of freedom with high-level accuracy, their efficiency level was less accessible and revealed in real-world (amputee) applications. This review paper examined the suitability of upper limb prosthesis (ULP) inventions in the healthcare sector from their technical control perspective. More focus was given to the review of real-world applications and the use of pattern recognition control on amputees. We first reviewed the overall structure of pattern recognition schemes for myo-control prosthetic systems and then discussed their real-time use on amputee upper limbs. Finally, we concluded the paper with a discussion of the existing challenges and future research recommendations.},

  abstract = {Digital processing of electroencephalography (EEG) signals has now been popularly used in a wide variety of applications such as seizure detection/prediction, motor imagery classification, mental task classification, emotion classification, sleep state classification, and drug effects diagnosis. With the large number of EEG channels acquired, it has become apparent that efficient channel selection algorithms are needed with varying importance from one application to another. The main purpose of the channel selection process is threefold: (i) to reduce the computational complexity of any processing task performed on EEG signals by selecting the relevant channels and hence extracting the features of major importance, (ii) to reduce the amount of overfitting that may arise due to the utilization of unnecessary channels, for the purpose of improving the performance, and (iii) to reduce the setup time in some applications. Signal processing tools such as time-domain analysis, power spectral estimation, and wavelet transform have been used for feature extraction and hence for channel selection in most of channel selection algorithms. In addition, different evaluation approaches such as filtering, wrapper, embedded, hybrid, and human-based techniques have been widely used for the evaluation of the selected subset of channels. In this paper, we survey the recent developments in the field of EEG channel selection methods along with their applications and classify these methods according to the evaluation approach.},

Management of TPNI requires familiarity with the relevant anatomy, pathology, pathophysiology, and the surgical principles, approaches and concerns. Surgical repair of TPNI is done at varying time intervals after the injury, and there are a number of considerations in deciding whether and when to operate. In neurapraxia, the compound muscle and nerve action potentials on stimulating distal to the lesion are maintained indefinitely; stimulation above the lesion reveals partial or complete conduction block. The picture in axonotmesis and neurotmesis depends on the time since injury. The optimal timing for an electrodiagnostic study depends upon the clinical question being asked. Although conventional teaching usually holds that an electrodiagnostic study should not be done until about 3 weeks after the injury, in fact a great deal of important information can be obtained by studies done in the first week. Proximal nerve injuries are problematic because the long distance makes it difficult to reinnervate distal muscles before irreversible changes occur.

  abstract = {Objective: Artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) is an automatic, online-capable, component-based method that can effectively remove transient or large-amplitude artifacts contaminating electroencephalographic (EEG) data. However, the effectiveness of ASR and the optimal choice of its parameter have not been systematically evaluated and reported, especially on actual EEG data. Methods: This paper systematically evaluates ASR on 20 EEG recordings taken during simulated driving experiments. Independent component analysis (ICA) and an independent component classifier are applied to separate artifacts from brain signals to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the ASR. Results: ASR removes more eye and muscle components than brain components. Even though some eye and muscle components retain after ASR cleaning, the power of their temporal activities is reduced. Study results also showed that ASR cleaning improved the quality of a subsequent ICA decomposition. Conclusions: Empirical results show that the optimal ASR parameter is between 20 and 30, balancing between removing non-brain signals and retaining brain activities. Significance: With an appropriate choice of parameter, ASR can be a powerful and automatic artifact removal approach for offline data analysis or online real-time EEG applications such as clinical monitoring and brain-computer interfaces.},

  abstract      = {Neuropathies are gaining higher relevance in clinical settings, as they risk permanently jeopardizing a person's life. To support the recovery of patients, the use of fully implanted devices is emerging as one of the most promising solutions. However, these devices, even if becoming an integral part of a fully complex neural nanonetwork system, pose numerous challenges. In this article, we address one of them, which consists of the classification of motor/sensory stimuli. The task is performed by exploring four different types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to extract various sensory stimuli from the electroneurographic (ENG) signal measured in the sciatic nerve of rats. Different sizes of the data sets are considered to analyze the feasibility of the investigated ANNs for real-time classification through a comparison of their performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and prediction time. The design of the ANNs takes advantage of the modelling of the ENG signal as a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system to describe the measures taken by state-of-the-art implanted nerve interfaces. These are based on the use of multi-contact cuff electrodes to achieve nanoscale spatial discrimination of the nerve activity. The MIMO ENG signal model is another contribution of this paper. Our results show that some ANNs are more suitable for real-time applications, being capable of achieving accuracies over \$90{\textbackslash}\%\$ for signal windows of \$100\$ and \$200{\textbackslash},\$ms with a low enough processing time to be effective for pathology recovery.},

We demonstrate how phase angle statistics can be used to gain confidence in causal relationships and test mechanistic models of physical relationships between the time series. As an example of typical data where such analyses have proven useful, we apply the methods to the Arctic Oscillation index and the Baltic maximum sea ice extent record. Monte Carlo methods are used to assess the statistical significance against red noise backgrounds.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Medical device manufacturers are obliged to prove the biocompatibility of their products when they come into contact with the human body. The requirements for the biological evaluation of medical devices are specified by the international standard series ISO 10993. Part five of this series describes the performance of in vitro cytotoxicity tests. This test evaluates the effects of medical device use on cell health. The existence of the specific standard suggests that the tests will produce reliable and comparable results. However, the ISO 10993-5 offers wide latitude in the test specifications. In the past, we noticed inconsistencies of the results from different laboratories. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the specifications of the standard ISO 10993-5 are explicit to ensure the comparability of test results and, if not, identify potential influencing factors. METHODS: An interlaboratory comparison was conducted for the in vitro cytotoxicity test according to ISO 10993-5. Fifty-two international laboratories evaluated the cytotoxicity for two unknown samples. One was polyethylene (PE) tubing, which is expected to be non-cytotoxic and the other was polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing, for which a cytotoxic potential was presumed. All laboratories were asked to perform an elution test with predefined extraction specifications. The other test parameters were freely chosen by the laboratories according to the guidelines set by the standard. RESULTS: To our surprise only 58 percent of the participating laboratories identified the cytotoxic potential of both materials as expected. Particularly for PVC a considerable variation of the results between the laboratories was observed [mean\,=\,43\,{\textpm}\,30 (SD), min\,=\,0, max\,=\,100]. We showed that ten percent serum supplementation to the extraction medium, as well as longer incubation of the cells with the extract, greatly increased the test sensitivity for PVC. CONCLUSION: The results clearly show that the specifications set by the ISO 10993-5 are not explicit enough to obtain comparable results for an identical medical device. To set requirements that ensure reliable cytotoxicity assessments, further research will be necessary to identify the best test conditions for specific materials and/or devices and the standard needs to be revised accordingly.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing to decode motor imagery (MI) involves high-dimensional features, which increases the computational complexity. To reduce this computational burden due to the large number of channels, an iterative multiobjective optimization for channel selection (IMOCS) is proposed in this paper. For a given MI classification task, the proposed method initializes a reference candidate solution and subsequently finds a set of the most relevant channels in an iterative manner by exploiting both the anatomical and functional relevance of EEG channels. The proposed approach is evaluated on the Wadsworth dataset for the right fist versus left fist MI tasks, while considering the cross-validation accuracy as the performance evaluation criteria. Furthermore, 12 other dimension reduction and channel selection algorithms are used for benchmarking. The proposed approach (IMOCS) achieved an average classification accuracy of about 80\% when evaluated using 35 best-performing subjects. One-way analysis of variance revealed the statistical significance of the proposed approach with at least 7\% improvement over other benchmarking algorithms. Furthermore, a cross-subject generalization of channel selection on untrained subjects shows that the subject-independent channels perform as good as using all channels achieving an average classification accuracy of 61\%. These results are promising for the online brain--computer interface (BCI) paradigm that requires low computational complexity and also for reducing the preparation time while conducting multiple session BCI experiments for a larger pool of subjects.},

  abstract   = {Peripheral nerve injury is a complex condition with a variety of signs and symptoms such as numbness, tingling, jabbing, throbbing, burning or sharp pain. Peripheral nerves are fragile in nature and can easily get damaged due to acute compression or trauma which may lead to the sensory and motor functions deficits and even lifelong disability. After lesion, the neuronal cell body becomes disconnected from the axon's distal portion to the injury site leading to the axonal degeneration and dismantlement of neuromuscular junctions of targeted muscles. In spite of extensive research on this aspect, complete functional recovery still remains a challenge to be resolved. This review highlights detailed pathophysiological events after an injury to a peripheral nerve and the associated factors that can either hinder or promote the regenerative machinery. In addition, it throws light on the available therapeutic strategies including supporting therapies, surgical and non-surgical interventions to ameliorate the axonal regeneration, neuronal survival, and reinnervation of peripheral targets. Despite the availability of various treatment options, we are still lacking the optimal treatments for a perfect and complete functional regain. The need for the present age is to discover or design such potent compounds that would be able to execute the complete functional retrieval. In this regard, plant-derived compounds are getting more attention and several recent reports validate their remedial effects. A plethora of plants and plant-derived phytochemicals have been suggested with curative effects against a number of diseases in general and neuronal injury in particular. They can be a ray of hope for the suffering individuals.},

  abstract      = {Brain computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct communication with a computer, using neural activity as the control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being as compact as possible. In this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI. We compare EEGNet to current state-of-the-art approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR). We show that EEGNet generalizes across paradigms better than the reference algorithms when only limited training data is available. We demonstrate three different approaches to visualize the contents of a trained EEGNet model to enable interpretation of the learned features. Our results suggest that EEGNet is robust enough to learn a wide variety of interpretable features over a range of BCI tasks, suggesting that the observed performances were not due to artifact or noise sources in the data.},

  abstract  = {Motor imagery is based on the volitional modulation of sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs); however, the sensorimotor processes in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are impaired, leading to degenerated motor imagery ability. Thus, motor imagery classification in ALS patients has been considered challenging in the brain--computer interface (BCI) community. In this study, we address this critical issue by introducing the Grassberger--Procaccia and Higuchi's methods to estimate the fractal dimensions (GPFD and HFD, respectively) of the electroencephalography (EEG) signals from ALS patients. Moreover, a Fisher's criterion-based channel selection strategy is proposed to automatically determine the best patient-dependent channel configuration from 30 EEG recording sites. An EEG data collection paradigm is designed to collect the EEG signal of resting state and the imagination of three movements, including right hand grasping (RH), left hand grasping (LH), and left foot stepping (LF). Five late-stage ALS patients without receiving any SMR training participated in this study. Experimental results show that the proposed GPFD feature is not only superior to the previously-used SMR features (mu and beta band powers of EEG from sensorimotor cortex) but also better than HFD. The accuracies achieved by the SMR features are not satisfactory (all lower than 80\%) in all binary classification tasks, including RH imagery vs. resting, LH imagery vs. resting, and LF imagery vs. resting. For the discrimination between RH imagery and resting, the average accuracies of GPFD in 30-channel (without channel selection) and top-five-channel configurations are 95.25\% and 93.50\%, respectively. When using only one channel (the best channel among the 30), a high accuracy of 91.00\% can still be achieved by the GPFD feature and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The results also demonstrate that the proposed Fisher's criterion-based channel selection is capable of removing a large amount of redundant and noisy EEG channels. The proposed GPFD feature extraction combined with the channel selection strategy can be used as the basis for further developing high-accuracy and high-usability motor imagery BCI systems from which the patients with ALS can really benefit.},

  abstract  = {The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm is commonly used to extract discriminative spatial filters for the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the context of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, CSP is based on a sample-based covariance matrix estimation. Therefore, its performance is limited when the number of available training samples is small. In this paper, the CSP method is considered in such a small-sample setting. We propose a regularized common spatial patterns (R-CSP) algorithm by incorporating the principle of generic learning. The covariance matrix estimation in R-CSP is regularized through two regularization parameters to increase the estimation stability while reducing the estimation bias due to limited number of training samples. The proposed method is tested on data set IVa of the third BCI competition and the results show that R-CSP can outperform the classical CSP algorithm by 8.5\% on average. Moreover, the regularization introduced is particularly effective in the small-sample setting.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an uncorrelated multilinear discriminant analysis (UMLDA) framework for the recognition of multidimensional objects, known as tensor objects. Uncorrelated features are desirable in recognition tasks since they contain minimum redundancy and ensure independence of features. The UMLDA aims to extract uncorrelated discriminative features directly from tensorial data through solving a tensor-to-vector projection. The solution consists of sequential iterative processes based on the alternating projection method, and an adaptive regularization procedure is incorporated to enhance the performance in the small sample size (SSS) scenario. A simple nearest-neighbor classifier is employed for classification. Furthermore, exploiting the complementary information from differently initialized and regularized UMLDA recognizers, an aggregation scheme is adopted to combine them at the matching score level, resulting in enhanced generalization performance while alleviating the regularization parameter selection problem. The UMLDA-based recognition algorithm is then empirically shown on face and gait recognition tasks to outperform four multilinear subspace solutions (MPCA, DATER, GTDA, TR1DA) and four linear subspace solutions (Bayesian, LDA, ULDA, R-JD-LDA).},

However, several previous studies show that CSP's performance deteriorates especially when the number of channels is large compared to small number of training datasets. As a result, it is necessary to choose an optimal subset of the whole channels to save computational time and retain high classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm to select the optimal channels for CSP. The CSP procedure is applied to training datasets firstly and then a channel score based on l{\textbackslash} norm is defined for each channel. Finally, channels with larger scores are retained for further CSP processing. This approach utilizes CSP procedure twice to select channels and extract features, respectively; hence the complex optimization problem of channel selection for CSP is solved heuristically. We apply our method and other two existing methods to datasets from BCI competition 2005 for comparison and the experiment results show this method provides an effective way to accomplish the task of channel selection.},

  abstract  = {To improve the spatial resolution of the electroen-cephalogram (EEG) signal, it is conventional to use a large number of scalp electrode while recording oscillatory rhythms in motor imagery based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). However, this increases the dimension of data and might fail to generalize and thus over-fit. Therefore, it is required to reduce the dimension of input data in an optimal way. In this paper, we propose a method using an artificial neural network to reduce the dimension of EEG for MI-BCI. We train an under-complete sparse autoencoder neural network for each subject separately to encode the EEG data optimally. The optimally encoded EEG trials are then used by the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) method to decode the imagined motor movement. In similar lines, autoencoder was trained on subject independent data. We achieved improved motor imagery classification accuracy when the dimension of the data was almost reduced by half compared to the state-of art FBCSP. The performance of the proposed method is also compared with Sparse Common Spatial Pattern (SCSP) based channel selection method. The average classification accuracy obtained for 10 subjects is 74.3{\textpm}8.06 \% with only 13 encoded channels. Also, for the autoencoder trained to be subject independent we obtained an average classification accuracy of 66.64{\textpm}3.93\% with only 11 encoded channels after cross-validation. The study extends the use of autoencoder neural networks in motor imagery based brain-computer interface and shows significant improvement in performance with reduced data dimension.},

  abstract = {Decryption of Motor Imagery (MI) activity from an Electroencephalogram (EEG) data is a significant part of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology that allows motor-disabled persons to connect with external devices. Channel selection, feature extraction, and classification are essential requirements for an effective BCI system. Non-stationary EEG data confuses designing EEG-based BCIs. In this study, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) technique is employed for channel selection for EEG signals in the BCI system. It selects the most associated fourteen channels for the sensorimotor area of subject's brain. The popular signal processing technique wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is employed for feature extraction. After that approximate entropy (ApEn) feature is calculated for selected channels. The proposed study is a novel scheme combining Pearson correlation coefficient-based channel selection technique and wavelet packet decomposition for classifying MI signals. Finally, extracted features are classified with the help of two benchmark techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and achieve maximum accuracy of 91.66\% and 90.33\%, respectively. The proposed technique is examined on freely available EEG datasets BCI competition-IV-Dataset I to prove its superiority over previously reported approaches. Obtained experimental findings demonstrated advantages over previous methods in terms of classification accuracy.},

  abstract = {Decoding of motor imagery (MI) from Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important component of BCI system that helps motor-disabled people interact with the outside world via external devices. One of the main issues associated with the multiclass classification of MI based EEG is the informative confusion due to non-stationary characteristics of EEG data. In this work, an innovative idea of transforming EEG signal into a new domain, weight vector of autoencoder, unsupervised neural network, is proposed for the first time to solve that confusion. These weight vectors are optimized according to that particular EEG signal. The features: autoregressive coefficients (ARs), Shannon entropy (SE) and wavelet leader were extracted from the weight vector. A rectangular windowing-based feature extraction technique is implemented to capture the local features of the EEG data. Finally, extracted features were used in the support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier network. The proposed method is implemented on two openly available EEG dataset (BCI competition-III and Competition-IV) to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology over the newly reported methods. For four-class EEG based MI classification, the proposed technique has achieved an average test accuracy of 95.33\% and 97\% for dataset-IIIa from BCI-III and dataset-IIa from BCI-IV respectively. The experimental results reveal that, the proposed technique is a promising solution to improve the decoding performance of BCIs.},

  abstract  = {Most of the BCI systems need EEG data with several channels to reach good accuracy. However, exceedingly increasing the channel need will increase the amount of calculation, and in some cases, decrease the accuracy and will also make the implementation of a BCI system difficult. Therefore, identifying the most effective channels in BCI systems is crucial because it will decrease the complexity and increase system accuracy. The Generalized Sequential forward selection (GSFS) method is used in this paper to choose the channel in a motor imagery BCI system for classification of right and left hand. Firstly, data is filtered to be in the frequency range of 4-30 Hz because the results of previous research revealed that the highest effect of motor imagery is exerted inside this frequency range. The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) features and frequency domain features are simultaneously used in order to improve the system performance. Moreover, a PCVM classifier is used to enhance the classification performance. Employing the GSFS method and also simultaneously extracting the CSP and frequency domain features have increased the system output accuracy. The computation cost of this method is low compared to that of the genetic algorithm method for channel selection. The classification precision in the method used in this research is higher with respect to that of the SVM-RFE method which shows the advantage of this method over other methods for channel selection in an MI-BCI system.},

The best classification results for three subjects are 90.8\%, 92.7\%, and 99.7\%. The spatial filters are estimated from a set of data by the method of common spatial patterns and reflect the specific activation of cortical areas. The method performs a weighting of the electrodes according to their importance for the classification task.

Thus, optimal channel selection becomes a key factor for developing a more comfortable BCI. This study emphasized on a time-frequency (T-F) coherence method, called as Wavelet Coherence (WC), for selecting lesser number of channels. The selected sets of channels were then used to classify two motor imagery (MI) tasks, i.e., right hand (RH) and right foot (RF). The data was collected from publicly available dataset IVa from BCI Competition III. Common spatial pattern (CSP) with and without regularization were applied as preprocessing techniques. While the classification accuracy is 90\% using available 118 channels for subject ay, we have achieved higher classification accuracy of 93\% using only 24 channels using CSP with regularization. Interestingly, the achieved classification accuracy for subject av is 67\% using 4 channels only, that outperform the classification accuracy (i.e., 61\%) achieved using 118 channels.},

Further progress and realization of practical applications depends on systematic evaluations and comparisons of different brain signals, recording methods, processing algorithms, output formats, and operating protocols. However, the typical BCI system is designed specifically for one particular BCI method and is, therefore, not suited to the systematic studies that are essential for continued progress. In response to this problem, we have developed a documented general-purpose BCI research and development platform called BCI2000. BCI2000 can incorporate alone or in combination any brain signals, signal processing methods, output devices, and operating protocols. This report is intended to describe to investigators, biomedical engineers, and computer scientists the concepts that the BCI2000 system is based upon and gives examples of successful BCI implementations using this system. To date, we have used BCI2000 to create BCI systems for a variety of brain signals, processing methods, and applications. The data show that these systems function well in online operation and that BCI2000 satisfies the stringent real-time requirements of BCI systems. By substantially reducing labor and cost, BCI2000 facilitates the implementation of different BCI systems and other psychophysiological experiments. It is available with full documentation and free of charge for research or educational purposes and is currently being used in a variety of studies by many research groups.},

Objective:~           To examine the incidence of peripheral nerve injury within 90 days of a limb trauma diagnosis in patients who have presented to the hospital or outpatient clinic.           Design:~           This study is a retrospective, descriptive study that uses the 1998 MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (The MEDSTAT Group) to track peripheral nerve injuries in extremity trauma. We selected our sample by using ICD9 codes for limb trauma during the first 9 mos of 1998. Nerve injuries within 90 days after limb trauma were the main outcome measure. Finally, we report how the rates of trauma and accompanying nerve injuries were contrasted by gender and age group, using univariate and bivariate statistics. All data analyses were conducted using Stata 9.0 statistical software.           Results:~           Out of 16 million insureds in the database, 220,593 (1.4\%) were diagnosed with limb trauma. Eighty-three percent of the patients were less than 55 yrs old, and 50\% were male. The total incidence of nerve injuries within 90 days of upper- or lower-limb trauma was 1.64\%. The type of extremity trauma with the highest incidence of nerve injury within 90 days of the diagnosis was a crush injury at 1.9\%. Approximately 50\% of our sample was selected because of a dislocation, which had an associated nerve injury prevalence of 1.46\%.           Conclusions:~           When looking at the population sampled, rates for peripheral nerve injury in people incurring limb trauma are low. Crush injuries seem to have the highest rate of associated nerve injury. Further studies are needed to observe outcomes for people with nerve damage after trauma.},

  abstract  = {Our current understanding of the basal ganglia has facilitated the creation of computational models that have contributed novel theories, explored new functional anatomy and demonstrated results complementing physiological experiments. However, the utility of these models extends beyond these applications. Particularly in neuromorphic engineering, where the basal ganglia\&\#39;s role in computation is important for applications such as power efficient autonomous agents and model-based control strategies. The neurons used in existing computational models of the basal ganglia however, are not amenable for many low-power hardware implementations. Motivated by a need for more hardware accessible networks, we replicate four published models of the basal ganglia, spanning single neuron and small networks, replacing the more computationally expensive neuron models with an Izhikevich hybrid neuron. This begins with a network modeling action-selection, where the basal activity levels and the ability to appropriately select the most salient input is reproduced. A Parkinson\&\#39;s disease model is then explored under normal conditions, Parkinsonian conditions and during subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. The resulting network is capable of replicating the loss of thalamic relay capabilities in the Parkinsonian state and its return under deep brain stimulation. This is also demonstrated using a network capable of action-selection. Finally, a study of correlation transfer under different patterns of Parkinsonian activity is presented. These networks successfully captured the significant results of the originals studies. This not only creates a foundation for neuromorphic hardware implementations but may also support the development of large-scale biophysical models. The former potentially providing a way of improving the efficacy of deep brain stimulation and the latter allowing for the efficient simulation of larger more comprehensive networks.},

In such a situation, defining where the whole swarm should land is a complex problem, since it depends on many pieces of information, such as, for instance, maximizing the availability of food or minimizing the risk of existence of predators.},

  abstract  = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) translates the subject's motor intention into a control signal through classifying the electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of different imagination tasks, e.g. hand and foot movements. Characteristic EEG spatial patterns make MI tasks substantially discriminable. Multi-channel EEGs are usually necessary for spatial pattern identification and therefore MI-based BCI is still in the stage of laboratory demonstration, to some extent, due to the need for constantly troublesome recording preparation. This paper presents a method for channel reduction in Mi-based BCI. Common spatial pattern (CSP) method was employed to analyze spatial patterns of imagined hand and foot movements. Significant channels were selected by searching the maximums of spatial pattern vectors in scalp mappings. A classification algorithm was developed by means of combining linear discriminant analysis towards event-related desynchronization (ERD) and readiness potential (RP). The classification accuracies with four optimal channels were 93.45\% and 91.88\% for two subjects},

  abstract = {The lack of adequate training samples and the considerable variations observed in the available image collections due to aging, illumination and pose variations are the two key technical barriers that appearance-based face recognition solutions have to overcome. It is a well-documented fact that their performance deteriorates rapidly when the number of training samples is smaller than the dimensionality of the image space. This is especially true for face recognition applications where only one training sample per subject is available. In this paper, a recognition framework based on the concept of the so-called generic learning is introduced as an attempt to boost the performance of traditional appearance-based recognition solutions in the one training sample application scenario. Different from contemporary approaches, the proposed solution learns the intrinsic properties of the subjects to be recognized using a generic training database which consists of images from subjects other than those under consideration. Many state-of-the-art face recognition solutions can be readily integrated in the proposed framework. A novel multi-learner framework is also proposed to further boost recognition performance. Extensive experimentation reported in the paper suggests that the proposed framework provides a comprehensive solution and achieves lower error recognition rate when considered in the context of one training sample face recognition problem.},

Comparing with the channels manually selected to over the motor cortex area, the correlation coefficient method is able to identify the optimal channel combination and improve the motor imagery decoding accuracy of Healthy and ALS subjects.},

  abstract      = {Objective. Many electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems use a large amount of channels for higher performance, which is time-consuming to set up and inconvenient for practical applications. Finding an optimal subset of channels without compromising the performance is a necessary and challenging task. Approach. In this article, we proposed a cross-correlation based discriminant criterion (XCDC) which assesses the importance of a channel for discriminating the mental states of different motor imagery (MI) tasks. Channels are ranked and selected according to the proposed criterion. The efficacy of XCDC is evaluated on two motor imagery EEG datasets. Main results. In both datasets, XCDC significantly reduces the amount of channels without compromising classification accuracy compared to the all-channel setups. Under the same constraint of accuracy, the proposed method requires fewer channels than existing channel selection methods based on Pearson's correlation coefficient and common spatial pattern. Visualization of XCDC shows consistent results with neurophysiological principles. Significance. This work proposes a quantitative criterion for assessing and ranking the importance of EEG channels in MI tasks and provides a practical method for selecting the ranked channels in the calibration phase of MI BCI systems, which alleviates the computational complexity and configuration difficulty in the subsequent steps, leading to real-time and more convenient BCI systems.},

The goal of this paper is to evaluate the quality of feature subsets generated by the various algorithms, and also compare their computational requirements. Our results show that the sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) algorithm, proposed by Pudil et al. (1994), dominates the other algorithms tested. This paper also illustrates the dangers of using feature selection in small sample size situations. It gives the results of applying feature selection to land use classification of SAR satellite images using four different texture models. Pooling features derived from different texture models, followed by a feature selection results in a substantial improvement in the classification accuracy. Application of feature selection to classification of handprinted characters illustrates the value of feature selection in reducing the number of features needed for classifier design.},
